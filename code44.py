Sure, here's an example of a simple function in Python that accepts two numbers as parameters:

```python
def add_two_numbers(num1, num2):
    sum = num1 + num2
    return sum
```

In this example, the function is named `add_two_numbers` and it accepts two parameters - `num1` and `num2`. Inside the function, it adds those two numbers together and stores the result in the variable `sum`. It then returns this sum.
