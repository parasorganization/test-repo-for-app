Sure, here is a simple Python function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum:

```python
def add_two_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```

Now, whenever you want to add two numbers, you could call this function and pass those two numbers as arguments, like this:

```python
result = add_two_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)  # Outputs: 8
```
