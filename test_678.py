Sure, here's a very basic function that adds two numbers in Python:

```python
def add_two_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```

You can use this function by calling it with two numbers. Like this:

```python
result = add_two_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output will be 8
```

In the above function, `num1` and `num2` are parameters of the function which will store the values you pass to the function when calling it. The `return` keyword is used to end the function and to specify the result of the function.
