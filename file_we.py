Here is a simple Python function that takes two numbers as its parameters and returns their sum:

```python
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

# Example usage
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)  # This will print 8
```

This function, `add_numbers`, expects two arguments (`num1` and `num2`), adds them, and returns the result.
