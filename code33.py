Sure, here is a simple Python function that adds two numbers:

```python
def add_two_numbers(number1, number2):
    return number1 + number2
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
result = add_two_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)  # Outputs: 8
```
In this example, the function 'add_two_numbers' is defined, which takes two parameters, `number1` and `number2`. It returns the sum of these two numbers.
