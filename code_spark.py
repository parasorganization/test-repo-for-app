To create a delta table with PySpark and Databricks, you'd need to follow a specific set of steps. However, it's important to note that Zoda doesn't have any direct relation to Databricks, Delta table, or PySpark. Here's a generic example:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create a SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder \
        .appName("Create Delta Table") \
        .getOrCreate()

# Create a DataFrame
data = [("John", "Doe", 30), ("Jane", "Doe", 35)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["FirstName", "LastName", "Age"])

# Save the DataFrame as a Delta table
df.write.format("delta").save("/tmp/delta-table")

# Read the Delta table
delta_df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/tmp/delta-table")

# Display the dataframe
delta_df.show()
```

This is a very basic script where the DataFrame is saved in Delta format and located at `/tmp/delta-table`.

Remember, this example would only work if your Spark cluster is properly set up to support Delta Lake. Delta Lake is a storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads. 

It's also important to note that to use Delta Lake on Databricks, which you mentioned in your query, you would have to create tables in a delta format on Databricks. 

Please refer to the official Databricks documentation and policies for the most accurate information.


User Level Estimation: The user appears to be an intermediate programmer. They are using PySpark and discussing concepts like functions and Delta tables, which are not typically beginner topics. However, the exact complexity of the task they're describing is not clear (because the query is not clearly defined), so it's difficult to classify them as an advanced programmer simply based on this query.

Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of the user's previous query is neutral.
