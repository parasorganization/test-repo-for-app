Sure, below is an example of a simple function in Python that adds two numbers:

```python
def add_two_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```

Here's how you would use it:

```python
sum = add_two_numbers(2, 3)
print(sum)  # Output will be: 5
```
The function `add_two_numbers` accepts two arguments (num1, num2) which represents the two numbers to be added. Inside the function, these numbers are added together with the '+' operator, and the result is returned by the function.
