Certainly! Below is a simple Python function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum:

```python
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

# Example usage
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

In this function, `num1` and `num2` are parameters that will accept the numbers you wish to add. The operation to add them is performed with the `+` operator, and the result is returned to wherever the function was called. The `# Example usage` part shows how to call the function with two numbers (5 and 3 in this case), and then prints the result (`8`).

User Level Estimation: Evaluating the user's programming expertise level can be quite challenging based solely on a request for a function to add two numbers, as it implies a very fundamental aspect of programming, which is basic arithmetic operations. This type of question is typically encountered at the beginner stage of programming learning. However, it does not provide strong evidence regarding the user's comprehensive programming skills, as the request might be for illustration, teaching, simplification, or testing basic concepts in a specific programming language context.

Given this, here are a few potential reasons behind the query and the corresponding inferred expertise levels:

1. **Absolute Beginner:** The user might be in the very early stages of learning to program. Understanding how to create functions and perform arithmetic operations are among the first steps in most programming languages.

2. **Beginner with Specific Context Interest:** The user might understand the concept of adding two numbers but could be exploring how to do it in a specific programming language or environment they are not familiar with. For example, someone familiar with Python syntax might wonder how the same is achieved in JavaScript or Rust.

3. **Intermediate Testing Simplicity:** An intermediate programmer might ask this question in the context of understanding the nuances or syntactic sugar of a particular language for function declaration. It could be about the differences in anonymous functions, lambdas, or arrow functions in modern languages.

4. **Advanced with a Teaching, Illustration, or Specific Use Case:** An advanced programmer might be looking for a way to illustrate a basic concept in the simplest form possible, perhaps for teaching, documentation, or as a basic building block for a more complex algorithmic challenge where function calls might be involved deeply (e.g., recursive functions).

Without further context, it's most safe to categorize the query as indicative of a **beginner** level of programming expertise. This categorization assumes the question's primary aim is to understand or practice fundamental programming concepts like variables, functions, and arithmetic operations which are core to beginning a programming journey.

Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of the user's previous query appears to be neutral. The query simply requests the creation of a function to perform a mathematical operation, without expressing any particular emotion or attitude.
