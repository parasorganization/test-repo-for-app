You can use Python's built-in `def` keyword to define a function. Here's a simple example of a function that adds two numbers:

```python
def add_two_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```

This function takes two parameters, `num1` and `num2`, and returns their sum. You can call this function with two numbers to get their sum. Like so:

```python
print(add_two_numbers(3, 4))  # Output: 7
```
