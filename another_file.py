Certainly! Here's a simple Python function to add two numbers:

```python
def add_two_numbers(num1, num2):
    """
    Function to add two numbers.

    Parameters:
    num1 (int/float): First number.
    num2 (int/float): Second number.

    Returns:
    int/float: The sum of num1 and num2.
    """
    return num1 + num2

# Example usage
result = add_two_numbers(5, 7)
print("The sum is:", result)
```

This function takes two parameters, `num1` and `num2`, which can be integers or floats, and returns their sum. You can call this function with two numbers as arguments to get their sum.

User Level Estimation: Based on this single query, it is most appropriate to categorize the user at the beginner level in programming. The task of writing a function to add two numbers is one of the most basic and initial exercises that one encounters when learning programming. It focuses on fundamental concepts such as functions and arithmetic operations, which are covered early in programming education, regardless of the programming language. This assessment is made with the understanding that expertise can vary widely and this query alone does not encompass the full range of the user's abilities or knowledge.

Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of the user's previous query is neutral. The request for writing a function is straightforward and does not convey any specific positive or negative emotion.
