Sure. Below is a simple Python function that adds two numbers:

```python
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```

You can use this function in your code by calling it with two numbers that you want to add. For example:

```python
result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)  # This will print: 8
```
