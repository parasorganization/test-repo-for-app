Sure, here's a simple Python function that adds two numbers together:

```python
def add_two_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```

You can call this function with two numbers you wish to add. For example:

```python
result = add_two_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)  # This will output: 8
```
This function uses the '+' operator to add the two numbers together, then returns the result.
