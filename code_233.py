Sure, below is a basic Python function that takes two numbers as inputs and returns the sum:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
```

You can call this function with two numbers to get their sum. For example:

```python
print(add_numbers(2, 3))  # Outputs: 5
```

This function should work for both float and integer inputs.
